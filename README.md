Projects for my code institute journey

For my first milestone project I will create a static website for a local Equestrian center, located about 20km from where I live. This site will hopefully create a less cluttered site for new and existing members.

The two main user stories that were my primary focus on this project were:
1. "As a potential new member, what do you offer me? and what will it cost?" 
2. "As an existing member, what activities can I take part in?"

For the first user story, I split it in to 2 parts. "General information about the center" and a "price list" of all services provided. The first part was easilly solved with a paragraph with information about the center. The second part was solved using a table with added prices for each activity

For the second user story I originally wanted to add an interactive calendar with each activity added on it's specific date. During the development of this project I realized that I couldn't get a HTML calendar to work as I wanted it without some javascripts. After alot of trial and error, I decided to forgo the calendar at this point(I will figure it out eventually), and instead create a static list of events for the next two week period.

In terms of testing the site, since it is a small static site there wasn't much testing required. It mainly focused on checking all links, site navigation and responsivness across platforms. All tests were done manually and passed without issues.
